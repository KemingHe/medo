# MEDO Launches to Bridge Critical Enterprise Data Gaps

> **FOR IMMEDIATE INTERNAL RELEASE**

## Multi-cloud Enterprise Data Orchestrator Enables Business Users to Access Cross-Platform Insights Without Technical Expertise

MEDO (Multi-cloud Enterprise Data Orchestrator) will launch next week, offering a groundbreaking solution that empowers business users to extract valuable insights from previously siloed data sources without writing a single line of SQL or requiring direct access to sensitive infrastructure.

## Eliminating the Business Intelligence Bottleneck

Today, when business teams need data-driven insights spanning multiple platforms, they face significant delays: submitting IT tickets, waiting for analyst availability, or attempting to learn technical skills outside their domain expertise. These bottlenecks impede decision-making and reduce organizational agility.

MEDO eliminates these barriers by deploying self-healing AI agents that understand natural language business questions, automatically access and query relevant data sources, and deliver actionable insights directly to business users.

## MVP Highlights: Customer Churn Risk Analysis

The initial release will demonstrate MEDO's capabilities through a focused use case: customer churn risk analysis. By seamlessly connecting Google BigQuery (containing subscription and billing data) with Firestore (tracking real-time customer engagement), MEDO enables business teams to identify at-risk customers before they cancel.

A business user can simply ask: "Which customers are at high risk of churning based on their recent platform usage and subscription history?" MEDO handles the complex technical work of:

- Translating the question into appropriate queries
- Accessing and joining data across both platforms
- Applying relevant analysis techniques
- Presenting findings in plain language

## Key Benefits

- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces analytics staffing needs by approximately one analyst per two database integrations
- **Speed to Insight**: Transforms multi-day processes into minutes
- **Enhanced Security**: Eliminates the need for temporary access privileges to sensitive data systems
- **Business User Empowerment**: Allows departments to self-serve their data needs without technical dependencies

## Next Steps

This initial release demonstrates MEDO's core capabilities with a focused dataset. Future iterations will expand to additional data sources and business use cases.
