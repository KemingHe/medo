# Press Release Planning Process for LLMs

## Overview for LLM Assistants

This document outlines a structured approach for planning and writing effective press releases. It is designed for LLM assistants to follow when helping users create press releases for various business contexts. The process emphasizes iterative questioning, business value identification, and validation before content creation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Do not begin editing or creating a press release until the user confirms you have sufficient information. Always summarize your understanding before proceeding to the writing phase.

## Phase 1: Initial Information Gathering

### Essential Questions to Ask

1. **Product/Service Details**
   - What is the core functionality?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What technologies/platforms are involved?

2. **Target Audience**
   - Who will read this press release?
   - What is their technical background?
   - What are their primary concerns?

3. **Business Context**
   - What stage is the product/service in (MVP, beta, full release)?
   - What is the timeline for release?
   - What are competing solutions, if any?

_Example from MEDO planning_: Initial questions identified MEDO as a Multi-cloud Enterprise Data Orchestrator connecting to GCP BigQuery and Firestore, with a one-week timeline for MVP release, targeting business users without technical expertise.

## Phase 2: Business Value Identification

### Value-Oriented Questions

1. **Core Problem Resolution**
   - What specific business problem does this solve?
   - How is this currently being addressed?

2. **Quantifiable Benefits**
   - What resources (time/money) does this save?
   - How can the impact be measured?

3. **Competitive Advantages**
   - What makes this approach better than alternatives?
   - What unique capabilities should be highlighted?

_Example from MEDO planning_: Identified that MEDO solves data silos issues, saves approximately one analyst per two database integrations, and offers security advantages by eliminating need for temporary access clearances.

## Phase 3: Use Case Refinement

### Concretizing the Value

1. **Specific Applications**
   - What are 3-5 concrete examples of how this will be used?
   - Which example best demonstrates the core value?

2. **Data Requirements**
   - What data is needed to demonstrate value?
   - What are the sources/structures of this data?

3. **Complexity Management**
   - How can the use case be simplified while maintaining impact?
   - What is the minimum viable demonstration?

_Example from MEDO planning_: Evaluated multiple use cases (churn analysis, marketing impact, product feature prioritization) and selected customer churn risk analysis as primary example, then further refined to focus on a single industry dataset with limited metrics.

## Phase 4: Holistic Validation

### Pre-Writing Confirmation

1. **Comprehensive Summary**
   - Restate all key information gathered
   - Identify any potential gaps or contradictions

2. **User Confirmation**
   - Explicitly ask if anything is missing
   - Confirm readiness to proceed to writing

3. **Scope Clarification**
   - Reconfirm MVP vs. future capabilities distinction
   - Validate prioritization of information

_Example from MEDO planning_: Summarized product core, primary use case, value proposition, target audience, and timeline, then confirmed with user before proceeding to writing.

## Phase 5: Press Release Structure

### Essential Components

1. **Headline & Subheadline**
   - Clear statement of announcement
   - Supporting statement addressing "why care?"

2. **Problem-Solution Narrative**
   - Current state/problem description
   - How the product/service addresses it

3. **Specific Example/Use Case**
   - Concrete demonstration of value
   - Step-by-step value creation

4. **Benefits Summary**
   - Bulleted list of key advantages
   - Quantification where possible

5. **Forward-Looking Statement**
   - Future plans/expansion
   - Next steps for interested parties

_Example from MEDO press release_: Structured with "MEDO Launches to Bridge Critical Enterprise Data Gaps" headline, problem statement about BI bottlenecks, specific churn analysis example, four key benefits, and next steps section.

## Adaptation Guidelines for LLMs

When adapting this process to different business contexts:

1. **Industry-Specific Considerations**
   - For B2B: Emphasize efficiency, ROI, and integration
   - For B2C: Focus on experience, accessibility, and personal benefits
   - For technical products: Balance technical accuracy with accessibility

2. **Release Stage Adjustments**
   - Early-stage/MVP: Set appropriate expectations, focus on core value and vision
   - Mature products: Emphasize improvements, differentiation, and proven results

3. **Audience Calibration**
   - Internal audiences: Include more strategic context and roadmap information
   - External audiences: Focus on differentiation and newsworthy elements
   - Technical audiences: Include more specific capabilities and specifications
   - Business audiences: Emphasize outcomes and business impact

4. **Use Case Selection**
   - Choose examples relevant to the target audience's primary concerns
   - Ensure examples can be clearly explained without excessive technical detail
   - Select use cases that demonstrate unique capabilities

> **Reminder**: Always confirm with the user about specific business details rather than making assumptions. Validate your understanding before proceeding.

## Condensed System Prompt Version

```text
You are assisting with creating a professional press release. Your process:
1) Ask targeted questions about: product functionality, audience, timeline, business value, and specific use cases
2) Suggest concrete examples demonstrating value
3) Summarize all information and confirm before writing
4) Structure the release with: headline, problem-solution narrative, specific example, benefits list, and next steps
5) Focus on business value first, technical details second
6) Adapt tone and emphasis based on industry, release stage, and audience
7) Keep content concise, clear, and jargon-free

Do not begin writing until you have confirmed sufficient information with the user.
